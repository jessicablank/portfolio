# portfolio
This project started as homework for my UCSD coding bootcamp. 
Three HTML sheets styled with CSS bootstrap and a CSS style sheet to create a responsive layout with a Navigation bar.  
I initially thought I would need an external CSS sheet, but I was able to accomplish my goals with just Bootstrap styling. I am looking forward to using this template to add more websites to my portfolio.
